# Web Architecture 

Q). What is a Stack ? <br>
ans: Stack is a collection of technologies. 

- Authentication: used to identify the users. (e.g: login to gmail)
  
- Authorization: used to provide the permission to either the data or functionality within an application.. <br>
  (e.g: through authorization, we used to add the product in flipkart).

- using XHR, we can make a request from Frontend/Client Side to Backend/ Server Side.
  
- If frontend directly interectly with database then, we are bypassing/skipping the security layer, backend is meant for security.
